JiveAudio is a set of media plugins for Mozilla.

On GNU/Linux, JiveAudio currently requires sox (play) and timidity
installed on your path.

== INSTALLATION ==

First, read the file INSTALL for basic instructions.

Netscape Plugin SDK is no longer required.

JiveAudio installs its plugins into `LIBDIR/mozilla/plugins' by
default.  If you do not have enough privileges, you can manually
install the plugins into your `$HOME/.mozilla/plugins' instead.
