JiveAudio is a multimedia plugin for Mozilla/Netscape.

In the GNU/Linux configuration, JiveAudio currently requires sox
(play) and timidity installed on your path.


COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- POSIX configuration:

  - Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (i386)

- Win32 configuration (to be verified):

  - Windows 98 (including Second Edition) with DirectX 8.0 (or later)
  - Windows Millennium Edition with DirectX 8.0 (or later)
  - Windows 2000 with DirectX 8.0 (or later)
  - Windows XP


COMPATIBLE COMPILERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- POSIX configuration:

  - GCC 2.95.X (Note that GCC 3.0 and later uses new incompatible C++
    ABIs, and thus cannot be used until Mozilla's default compiler is
    changed.)

- Win32 configuration:

  - Borland C++Builder 6 (or later)


INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, read the file INSTALL for basic instructions.

Netscape Plugin SDK is no longer required.

This package installs the plugin files into `LIBDIR/jiveaudio' by
default.  To use JiveAudio in your browser, you must copy or symlink
them into your browser's plugin directory by hand.
