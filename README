JiveAudio is a multimedia plugin for Mozilla.

In the POSIX configuration, JiveAudio currently requires sox (play)
and timidity installed on your path.


COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

POSIX configuration:

- Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (i386)

Win32 configuration (to be verified):

- Windows 98 (including Second Edition) with DirectX 8.0 (or later)
- Windows Millennium Edition with DirectX 8.0 (or later)
- Windows 2000 with DirectX 8.0 (or later)
- Windows XP


COMPATIBLE COMPILERS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

POSIX configuration:

- GCC 3.2.X (or later)

Win32 configuration:

- Borland C++Builder 6 (or later)


INSTALLATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First, read the file INSTALL for basic instructions.

Netscape Plugin SDK is no longer required.

This package installs the plugin files into 'LIBDIR/jiveaudio' by
default.  To use JiveAudio in your browser, you must copy or symlink
them into your browser's plugin directory by hand.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Win32 configuration, this program may not work when it is used
by restricted user accounts because it is unlikely for those accounts
to have a write permission to the current directory which is normally
the browser's installation directory.  This will be fixed later.
